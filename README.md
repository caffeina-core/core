Core follows the [GitFlow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model). The ```master``` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the ```develop``` branch.

Each time you want to work on a fix or a new feature, create a new branch based on the ```develop``` branch: ```git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop```. Only pull requests to the ```develop``` branch will be merged.

Pull requests are **highly appreciated**.

Solve a problem. Features are great, but even better is cleaning-up and fixing issues in the code that you discover.
